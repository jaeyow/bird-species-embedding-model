embedding model against our bird species dataset, we can then use it to generate embeddings for our bird species images. This is done by passing the images through the model and extracting the embeddings from the last layer of the model. Because we have removed the classification head, our model now just spits out the embeddings of the image we pass in.\n","\n","So now (compared to just using the pre-trained model) similar images will have a substantially higher similarity than a dissimilar image. This is because the model has been fine-tuned to recognise the specific features of the bird species in our dataset.\n","\n","For example, in the similar case we get a score of `0.90834`, while the dissimilar image case gets a score of `0.31791`. This is a significant difference compared to using the pre-trained model, and shows that the model has learned to differentiate between the two images better."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Can we fine tune against a smaller dataset?\n","\n","Actually, if all we need are the embeddings, we can then fine tune against a smaller dataset (like 10 classes), instead of all the 525 classes.
